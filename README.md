# CheckCornerWithOne
This Program is about check whether is their any sub matrix is present whose 4 corner with 1

suppose e.g 1:
1  0  0  1  0  
0  0  1  0  0  
0  0  0  1  0  
1  0  1  0  1
then O/P will 'No' because their is no any submatrix whose corner are 1.

suppose e.g 2:
1  0  0  1  0
0  0  1  0  0
1  0  0  1  0
1  0  1  0  1
then O/P will 'Yes' because their is submatrix whose corner are 1.
